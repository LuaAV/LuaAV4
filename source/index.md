Real-time audiovisual scripting using Lua(JIT)

LuaAV is a real-time audiovisual scripting environment based around the Lua scripting language and a collection of extensions for sound, graphics, and media protocols, to enable the tight real-time integration of computation, time, sound and space. It is intended to support:

- Computational audio-visual composition
- Interactive and generative art and music
- Multimedia development research
- Scientific visualization

The new development version of LuaAV is hosted [here](https://github.com/LuaAV/libluaav); the previous stable version of LuaAV can be found at [http://lua-av.mat.ucsb.edu/blog/](http://lua-av.mat.ucsb.edu/blog/).
